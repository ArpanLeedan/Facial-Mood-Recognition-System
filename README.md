# Facial-Mood-Recognition-System
This project implements a Facial Mood Detection System using Python and Keras, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the FER (Facial Expression Recognition) dataset.

Features
Facial Expression Recognition: Detects and recognizes facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
CNN with Keras: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network model built with Keras for accurate prediction.
FER Dataset: Trained and evaluated using images from the FER dataset.
Python Scripts: Includes scripts for training the model, testing on sample images, and real-time detection using webcam.
Requirements
Python (>=3.x)
Keras
TensorFlow (or other backend for Keras)
OpenCV (for capturing or processing images)
Numpy
Matplotlib
